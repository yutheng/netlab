Hosts are ready to go (each has default gateways). The routers are not: forwarding
is switched off and they only know their directly connected networks.

Run it inside the lab container, with the last 4 digits of your student ID:
    python3 routers.py --id 4207

Step 10 configures the routers from data instead of by hand:
    python3 routers.py --id 4207 --routes routes.yaml
checks every route first, and only then switches forwarding on and applies them.
